# Analysis for ride sharing company.

Using two data sets with information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type, give recommendation on new opportunities for market differentiation.

## 1. Data Analysis 
To approach this problem I build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

and additional three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
